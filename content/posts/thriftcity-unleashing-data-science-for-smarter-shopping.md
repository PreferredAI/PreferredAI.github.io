## **The Data Pipeline: Fueling Intelligence**

At the core of ThriftCity lies a robust data pipeline—an intricate web of automated processes that fuels our platform.

1. **Data Retrieval:** Leveraging the abundance of online retail data, we collect product and pricing information from multiple sources and consolidate it into our central database.

1. **Data Processing:** Standardizing and preprocessing data is crucial for accurate comparison and matching. By harmonizing data from diverse retailers, we optimize compatibility for subsequent steps.

1. **Data Matching:** Employing machine learning techniques, we automate the comparison of products from different retailers, grouping them without manual intervention to facilitate seamless price comparison.

1. **Data Loading:** Once matched and processed, the data is loaded into structured formats, ready for consumption by our user-facing solution.

## **Microservices Architecture: The Backbone**

ThriftCity’s architecture is akin to a symphony of microservices from the data pipeline to the user-facing solution, each playing a crucial role:

- **Scalability**: Microservices scale independently. For heavy requests such as data processing and data matching.

- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Isolated microservices mean focused development and easier maintenance.

- **Interoperability**: APIs connect the dots. ThriftCity evolves harmoniously, integrating seamlessly with other services.
