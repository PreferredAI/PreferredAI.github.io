# CIKM-2018 in Turino, Italy

In October, Andrew attended the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2018) that was organized in Torino, Italy. Here, he shares his experience of the Torino trip.

CIKM 2018 was hosted at the Centro Congressi Lingotto, which is part of the old Fiat factory in the Lingotto area of Turin. On top of this building, you can still visit the old Fiat’s roof driving track where all Fiat’s cars were tested.
