# Good Things Come in Threes

On 27 November 2023, Chia Chong Cher (that’s *three* C’s) successfully defended his dissertation entitled “Effective and Efficient Semantic Representations and Their Applications”.

His dissertation had *three* main thrusts. First, effective and efficient representations of textual data via vocabulary reduction. Second, effective and efficient representations of knowledge bases via selection of important nodes. Third, the application of semantic representations, particularly in the legal NLP domain. Interestingly, each of the three was anchored in a publication or a submission with *three* authors, with Chong Cher as the first.

Chong Cher has had a long association with Preferred.AI. As an undergraduate in the Information Systems programme, he participated in an undergraduate research assistantship. This eventually led to his pursuit and recent completion of the PhD programme.

After completing his BSc and PhD degrees, Chong Cher is accomplishing a hat trick by embarking on his *third* association with SMU, this time as a Senior Research Associate at the [SMU Centre for Computational Law](https://cclaw.smu.edu.sg/).

Here is wishing that good things will keep coming his way!
