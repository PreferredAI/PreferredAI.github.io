# IJCAI 2019 in Macau, China

In August 2019, [Andrew](/team/andrew/) attended the 28th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-2019). He shares his learning and experience in this blog post.

Given how skillful these artists are, how soon will they be replaced by robots?
Well, not soon! 😀

In IJCAI 2019, Andrew presented his paper on “***[Learning Multiple Maps from Conditional Ordinal Triplets](http://www.hadylauw.com/publications/ijcai19b.pdf)***“, introducing the problem of modelling multiple similarity perspectives from the similarity triplets. The paper also proposes a geometric framework to effectively model multiple similarity perspectives from the ordinal similarity triplets. This aims at learning multiple low-dimensional representations from such similarity triplets, each reflecting a specific similarity perspective.

[Preferred.AI](/) also has another paper in IJCAI 2019, titled “***[Correlation-Sensitive Next-Basket Recommendation](http://www.hadylauw.com/publications/ijcai19a.pdf)***, discussing the next-basket recommendation problem. Motivated by the observation that items are commonly adopted concurrently, e.g., a basket of grocery items or a sitting of media consumption, this paper deals with a sequence of baskets as input, and seeks to recommend the next basket.

IJCAI is always a great venue to meet and learn from world-class AI researchers and practitioners. [Preferred.AI](/) will definitely be back again![](/uploads/2023/05/IMG_6640.jpg)
