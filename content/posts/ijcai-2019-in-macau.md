# IJCAI 2019 in Macau, China

In August 2019, [Andrew](https://preferred.ai/team/andrew/) attended the 28th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-2019). He shares his learning and experience in this blog post.

IJCAI 2019 was hosted in Macau, China, gathering more than 3000 AI scholars and industry leaders. This year, IJCAI received a huge amount of submissions, i.e., 4752, which resulted in 17.8% acceptance rate (850 papers). This is a record for IJCAI, showing a rapidly increasing interest in AI.

IJCAI 2019 started with many activities: tutorials, workshops, demos, followed by the main conference sessions. On the first day of the conference, participants were treated with an amazing Kylin dance performance from the local artists. This signaled a very fruitful, educational, and eye-opening experience for me.

In IJCAI 2019, Andrew presented his paper on “***[Learning Multiple Maps from Conditional Ordinal Triplets](http://www.hadylauw.com/publications/ijcai19b.pdf)***“, introducing the problem of modelling multiple similarity perspectives from the similarity triplets. The paper also proposes a geometric framework to effectively model multiple similarity perspectives from the ordinal similarity triplets. This aims at learning multiple low-dimensional representations from such similarity triplets, each reflecting a specific similarity perspective.

[Preferred.AI](https://preferred.ai/) also has another paper in IJCAI 2019, titled “***[Correlation-Sensitive Next-Basket Recommendation](http://www.hadylauw.com/publications/ijcai19a.pdf)***, discussing the next-basket recommendation problem. Motivated by the observation that items are commonly adopted concurrently, e.g., a basket of grocery items or a sitting of media consumption, this paper deals with a sequence of baskets as input, and seeks to recommend the next basket.

IJCAI 2019 was also an opportunity for conference attendants to explore Macau, a special administrative zone of China. Macau is famous for many huge and luxury hotels with a countless number of casinos. Visitors can easily find themselves in a casino just by walking from hotels to hotels.

IJCAI is always a great venue to meet and learn from world-class AI researchers and practitioners. [Preferred.AI ](https://preferred.ai/)will definitely be back again!
