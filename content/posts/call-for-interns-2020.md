# Call for Interns 2020

[Preferred.AI](/people/) is calling for internship applications from current students of [SMU](https://www.smu.edu.sg/) to work with us during the summer (May to July 2020) on a number of cool projects! Fruitful projects will be showcased at our upcoming **TechFest 2020** (our highly-attended [2019 event](/techfest2019/) was featured in the [SMU blog](https://blog.smu.edu.sg/doctoral/smu-techfest-2019-preferred-ai-artificial-intelligence/)). For a taste of what our 2019 interns did, go to the **video** at the end of this post.

Sample projects on offer for the 2020 summer are listed below. Keep checking this space for new projects on offer.

**A. FaceInMotion 2: Building an AI that can understand human emotion**
Build an AI that can understand human emotion. Extend FaceInMotion, a system that focuses on analysing human emotion from facial expressions using state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms.

**B. Butler 2: Conversational recommender system with explanations**
Develop and investigate different explanations for an interactive conversational recommender system, which would generate natural language explanations for why a certain product is recommended.

**C. MindReader 2: Unsupervised topic learning for news recommendation**
Build a news recommendation app that extracts internal topics from observed news articles for recommendation by constructing a news “social network” to aggregate short texts; and leveraging external large corpus.

**D. Neural Network Lab 2: Machine learning in your browser**
Neural Network Lab is a web-based interactive visual development environment for neural network and deep learning models. Build more features to and extend the functionality of the tool.

**E. Opinion Analytics: Machine learning for review analysis**
With the use of natural language processing technologies, build a prototype machine learning system for review analysis. Given a text, we seek to understand its polarity and to identify the reviewed aspects.

**F. VIS-Concepts: Image search with visual concepts**
Build visual search engine by training a machine learning model that incorporates semantic concepts involving similar images and learns varying user-perceived similarity perspectives.

**G. Learning to expand short texts**
Given short text as an input (e.g., less than 100 words), develop a machine learning model to produce a more detailed version (with a richer vocabulary), while preserving the key concepts and ideas from the original.

**To apply**, email [hadywlauw@smu.edu.sg](mailto:hadywlauw@smu.edu.sg) by 30 March 2020 with your resume and recent transcript, while stating which projects are of interest and whether you are currently on scholarship. Slots are limited, and each project will be matched as soon as we find a suitable candidate.
