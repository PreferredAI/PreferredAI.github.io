This was first-authored by [Zhang Ce](https://sites.google.com/view/delvincezhang), also in collaboration with [Rex Ying](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/), who will be his future postdoc supervisor at Yale University. The paper itself was presented both orally as well as a poster.

Hady and Tuan at dinner

At the conference, Hady also met [Tuan](https://www.qttruong.com/), who is now with Amazon and flew in from Vancouver. Catching up over meals and drinks, we also found the time to enjoy the sun and the beach, as well as cycling over the long stretch of Long Beach.
