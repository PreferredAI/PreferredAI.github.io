# KDD 2022 in Washington, D.C.

In August 2022, Hady, Zhang Ce, and Thuat travelled to Washington D.C. to attend the 28th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD for short). This year, KDD came back to an in-person event after two years of virtual events. The conference welcomed more than two thousand attendees, including both academic and industrial researchers.

This year, Preferred.AI contributed two research papers to KDD. The first paper titled ‘[Variational Author Topic Modeling](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vb3q8ga5theokgp/kdd22a.pdf?dl=0)’, authored by Zhang Ce and Hady, proposes to incorporate semantic interpretability and authorship modeling into a unified VAGE framework to enhance document representation. This paper was selected to conduct a 15-minute oral presentation in Text Mining session.

Our group’s second paper, authored by Thuat and Hady, titled ‘[Aligning Dual Disentangled User Representations from Ratings and Textual Content](https://www.dropbox.com/s/67w698un2n63loy/kdd22b.pdf?dl=0)’, was presented in Recommender Systems session. The paper proposes to learn a set of disentangled user’s representations from textual content and align them with disentangled representations derived from ratings to improve recommendation performance and interpretability. 

We also attended a 90-minute poster session, which engaged more audiences to dive deeper into specific problems. Poster session was also a great chance to learn from other researchers’ experience as well as get to know more people in the field.
