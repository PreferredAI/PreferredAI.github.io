# IJCAI-18 in Stockholm

In July 2018, Hady traveled to Stockholm, Sweden for the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI).  Here, he recounts his experience from the trip.

IJCAI-18 was probably the largest academic conference I ever participated in so far, with 2500 registered attendees.  This was 20% larger than the 2017 conference.  This pronounced growth and outsized congregation is one more sign of the rise (the return?) of Artificial Intelligence or AI.

The conference organizer knew how to put up a show.  The scene-stealer during the opening ceremony was definitely the dancing couple of human and robot, gyrating harmoniously to the catchy beat.  Talk about what AI can do![](/uploads/2018/07/ijcai18_dancing-e1532825326999.jpg)

Our Preferred.AI group has 2 papers accepted to the conference.  Both were presented in the Learning Preferences or Rankings session.  The first paper “[Modeling Contemporaneous Basket Sequences with Twin Networks for Next-Item Recommendation](http://www.hadylauw.com/publications/ijcai18a.pdf)” by [Trong](/team/trong/), [Hady](/team/hadylauw/), and [Yuan](http://www.yfang.site) explores the interaction between two behavioral streams that are occurring concurrently, such as clicking and purchasing on an e-commerce site, and how they can be modeled jointly to improve sequential recommendation.

The second paper “[A Bayesian Latent Variable Model of User Preferences with Item Context](http://www.hadylauw.com/publications/ijcai18b.pdf)” by [Aghiles](/team/aghiles/) and [Hady](/team/hadylauw/) describes a novel graphical model based on Poisson factorization that incorporates item context information, such as which items are viewed together, in addition to  user-item interactions, to improve recommendations especially for users with more limited information.

In addition to the oral presentations in the session, we also got a chance to engage the audience in a poster session.  This allowed deep dives into specific issues, which would take more time and one-on-one discussions.  For instance, from a discussion with a researcher from a large online retailer, I learnt about how prevalent recurrent neural networks were in the company’s sequential recommendation models.

The two things that surprised me the most about Stockholm were the weather and the water.  While it was summer then, I was still struck by how a place so far north could be so warm.  No wonder the humidity is high, because water is everywhere![](/uploads/2018/07/ijcai18_cityhall.jpg)

Prior to the trip, the thing I associated the most with Sweden was the Nobel Prize.  So a visit to Stockholm would not have been complete without experiencing the Nobel Museum.  While the museum has many artefacts connected to various prize winners over the years, the greatest find in my exploration was the cafe![](/uploads/2018/07/ijcai18_nobel.jpg)
