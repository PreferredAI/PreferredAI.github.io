# Connecting The Dots

On 12 May 2023, Zhang Ce successfully defended his dissertation, entitled “Document Graph Representation Learning”. The gist of it is to derive more holistic representations of documents by incorporating both their textual content as well as their network connectivity to other documents.

His first publication on this topic, AdjacentEncoder, was presented at the AAAI-20 conference. New York then was Zhang Ce’s first trip to the United States.
