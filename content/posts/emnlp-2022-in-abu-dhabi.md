# EMNLP 2022 in Abu Dhabi

Jia Peng attended the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2022) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, from 7 to 11 December. As expected from being one of the top venues in Computational Linguistics, EMNLP 2022 received 4190 full paper submissions, its largest to date. Of these, 829 papers (~20%) made it to the main conference. The opening keynote by Neil Cohn on visual languages of comics was engaging and intriguing. While many presentations and poster sessions were happening concurrently, there is a nice balance of crowds at various points of interest. To top it off, there was a welcome reception and a lavish social event (unfortunately, it rained during the middle of it).

Preferred.AI research group has one paper at EMNLP’22: [**Towards Reinterpreting Neural Topic Models via Composite Activations**](https://preview.aclanthology.org/emnlp-22-ingestion/2022.emnlp-main.242/), authored by Jia Peng and Hady. Before this work, most Neural Topic Models derive their topics using one neuron to one topic interpretation. In our approach, we use many neurons for one topic interpretation to derive better generalisable topics from existing Neural Topic Models.
