# KDD.SG Tutorial on Image Classification Using CNN (Materials)

Our appreciation to [KDD.SG](http://kdd.sg) (Singapore Chapter of SIGKDD) and [DSSG](http://datascience.sg/) (DataScience Singapore) for jointly organizing and inviting us to deliver a public tutorial on June 9.  [Tuan](/team/tuan/) and [Hady](/team/hadylauw/) delivered a tutorial on image classification using convolutional neural networks, focusing on two applications, namely: face emotion recognition and visual sentiment analysis.
