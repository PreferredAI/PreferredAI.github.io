# Robustly Poly-Skilled

On 25 June 2024, Lee Ween Jiann successfully defended his dissertation, titled “Incorporating Intrinsic Structures into Entity Matching and Representation Learning”. The work came in two parts.

The first part looked into algorithms for facilitating entity matching, when an entity from one side could match multiple entities on the other side (*poly-matching*), but the “one” and the “many” could come from either side (*bipoly-matching*).

The second part studied representation learning, particularly for geospatial entities, whereby the relative distance and directions were taken into account in feature learning.

Ween first joined PreferredAI in 2017 as a research engineer, out of an undergraduate business school. In 2019, he transitioned into a PhD candidate.

He had an almost CrossFit-like approach to PhD training. While pursuing research, he had the the time, the skills, and the willingness to undertake various activities, such as teaching, mentoring younger students, organizing events, maintaining our compute system, and pursuing entrepreneurial ventures. As a result, as he graduated with credible papers under his belt ([ICDM-21](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8521onz9y377fop/icdm21.pdf?dl=0), [TKDE-23](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tkozsr6uf4fnaa07jdgdp/tkde23bipoly.pdf?rlkey=t3jslks6z93oa1yynfs592su2&dl=0), [TSAS-24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3663474)) as well as SMU Presidential Doctoral Fellowship, he also brought with him a diverse array of skillsets that would stand him in good stead in the future.

We wish him all the best for his next endeavour!
